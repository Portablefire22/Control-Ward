# Control Ward

## Isn't this a Twitch feature already?

Yes but I only realised ***after*** making this and I can't even say it's to provide "customisability" since
Twitch already let you pick and choose notifications, so let's just say that this tool is for when you want to
know when someone is streaming without following them?

In reality, this concept entered my mind and I kinda wanted to try my hand at it. This project reinforced my hatred
towards web development - JavaScript in particular - and has proven to me that other projects aren't *that* bad.

## Why "Control Ward"

League of Legends reference. I made this because I got annoyed at missing Ratirl streams, so I picked the name of
an item that reveals hidden entities around it.
